To run the code:
1. Change Matlab work directory to "/HGLMF/".
2. Run  "loadpah" code to add the current folder and subfolders into Matlab path searching list.
3. Open and run the  mianZ.m. 


mianZ.m：All experiments in three scenarios with four data sets

The “main_cv1” folder contains related experiments on four datasets
five_cross.m： 5-fold cross validation 


The “Algorithms” folder contains the relevant calculation code for HGLMF:
HGLMF_opt：Hypergraph-based logistic matrix factorization.

The Dataset folder contains all experimental data in this paper:
